# Nap Trap Project - Driver Drowsiness Detection System 

## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the front-end of the mobile application for the Nap Trap Project (Driver Drowsiness Detection System). I used React Native to build front-end of the mobile application, and utilized Expo, which provided a set of pre-configured libraries and components that allowed for rapid prototyping and efficient deployment of the app.
